What is Multitasking ?
------------------------

 Executing multiple tasks simultaniously is called multitasking.

 There are two types of multitasking :
 --------------------------------------

 1. Process Based Multitasking 
 2. Thread Based Multitasking 

                1. Process Based Multitasking :
                ------------------------------- 

- Executing several tasks simultaniously where each task is a separated indepedent part, this is called as Process based multitasking.
- Process based multitasking suitable at os level only.

                2. Thread Based Multitasking :
                ------------------------------

- Executing several task simultaniously where each task is a separated indepedent part of the Same Program , this  is called as Thread Based
multitasking.
- Thread based multitasking only suitable at programatic level.



Main advantages of Multitasking :
----------------------------------

- The main advantages of multitasking is to reduce the response time of the system and perfomance by default will be improved.


What is Thread ?
--------------------

- The separate flow of Execution is called Thread.
- For every Thread there is some job is there.



How we can define a Thread ? 
-----------------------------

There is two ways of defining a Thread : 
----------------------------------------

1. By extending a Thread class
2. By Implementing Runnable Interface 





1. Defining a Thread By extending a Thread class
-------------------------------------------------

class MyThread extends Thread 
{
    public void run()
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            System.out.println("Child Thread !");
        }
    }
}
public class DefiningThread1
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        MyThread obj = new MyThread();
        obj.start();
        

        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            System.out.println("Main Thread !");
        }
    }
}




What is Thread Scheduler ?
---------------------------

It is the part of Jvm. Thread Scheduler decides which Thread will get a chance to execute and when. We can not expect the executing
order of Thread Scheduler because it is varried from JVM to JVM and we can not tell the exact algorithm followed by the Thread Scheduler.


Diffrence between start(); and run(); method : 
-----------------------------------------------

- To start a new Thread we are required to call start(); method, which is responsible to invoke run(); method. 
Without the start(); method a new Thread can not be created.

- In the case of run(); method, no new Thread will be created and run(); method will be executed just like normal method.


Importance of start(); method : 
--------------------------------

- start(); method is responsible for registering a new Thread with Thread Scheduler and all other activities, hence without executing 
start(); method there is no chance of starting a new Thread in Java. 

- Due to this start(); method is considerd as the heart of MultiThreading .


Overloading of a run(); method ;
---------------------------------

Overloading of run(); method is possible however start(); method can only be used with no-arg run(); method and run(int i); method with 
argument, we have to call it manually and it will be executed just as normal method executes .



What if we not overriding run(); method ? 
------------------------------------------

if we are not overriding run(); method then Thread class run(); method will be executed, which has empty implementation, hence we will not
get any output. It is highly recommended to override run(); method otherwise don't go for Multithreading concept.


Overriding of the start(); method :
------------------------------------

If we Override start(); method then our start(); method will be executed just as like normal method and new Thread won't be created,
so it is highly recommended to not override start(); method otherwise don't go for MultiThreading concept.


super.start(); method : 
--------------------------









2.   Defining Thread by Implementing Runnable Interface : 
-----------------------------------------------------

class MyRunnable implements Runnable
{
    public void run()
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            System.out.println("Executing by Child Thread !");
        }
    }
}
public class DefiningThread2
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        MyRunnable mr = new MyRunnable();
        Thread t = new Thread(mr);
        t.start();

        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            System.out.println("Executing by Main Thread !");
        }
    }
}

    



                            Case Study on Runnable Interface 
                            --------------------------------





MyRunnable obj = new MyRunnable();
Thread t1 = new MyThread();
Thread t2 = new MyThread(obj);


case-1: t1.start();
-------------------
In the case of t1.start(); , A new Thread will be created which is responsible of execution of Thread class run(); method, which is the empty 
implementation.



case-2: t1.run();
-----------------
In the case of t1.run(); the method t1.run(); will be executed just like a normal method and new Thread won't be created.



case-3: t2.start();
-------------------

A new Thread will be created, which is the responsible for executing the MyRunnable class run(); method.




case-4: t2.run();
-----------------

In this case MyRunnable class run(); method will be executed just like normal method and new Thread will not be created.



case-5: obj.start();
--------------------

in this case we will get a RunTimeException saying "can not find symbol start(); in MyRunnable class. 



case-6 obj.run();
-----------------

In this case MyRunnable run(); method will be executed just like a normal method and new Thread will not be created.






Which approach is recommended to define a Thread ? By extending Thread class or Implementing Runnable Interface ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Among two ways of defining a Thread Implementing Runnable Interface is recommended.
- In the first approach we are always extending class and there is no chance of extending other class hence we are missing inheritance benifits.
- However in the second approach while implementaing Runnable Interface we can extend any other class hence we will not miss any inheritance
  benifits.
- because of above reason Defining a Thread by Implementing Runnable Interface is always recommended over extending Thread class.






Getting & Setting the name of a Thread :
---------------------------------------

to get a name of a Thread :
--------------------------- 

System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());\


to Set a name of a Thread : 
---------------------------
System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().setName());


Thread Priorities : 
-------------------

- Every Thread in Java has some Priorities. It may be default priority generated by JVM or custumized priority provided by JVM.
- The valid range of Thread priority is from 1 to 10 where 1 is min priority,5 is normal priority and 10 is max priority.


Thread class defines the following constant to represented some standard priority : 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thread.MIN_PRIORITY  - 1
Thread.NORM_PRIORITY - 5
Thread.MAX_PRIORITY  - 10


- Thread Scheduler will use this Priorities while allocating processor. The Thread which has Max priority will get a chance to execute first.
- If two Threads having same priority then we can not expect the exact execution order. It depends on Thread Scheduler.






Default Priority : 
------------------
The default priority only for main Thread is 5 , However for all remaining Threads the default priority will be inherited from Parent to Child 
, Whatever priority the parent Thread has the same priority will be inherited to Child Thread.









Prevent Thread execution : 
---------------------------
There are three types of method which we can use to prevent the Thread from executing for temporary time .. 

1. yeild(); method 
2. join(); method 
3. sleep(); method



1. yeild();
------------
- yeild method causes to pause current executing Thread to give the chance to waiting Threads with same priority. If there is no waiting or 
all waiting Threads have low priority then same Thread can continue its execution.

- If multiple Threads are waiting with same Priorities then which waiting Thread will get a chance we can not expect it depends on Thread
Scheduler.

- The Thread which is yeild();, when it will get chance again it depends on Thread Scheduler and we can not expect exact order of executing.




yeild(); method example :
-------------------------


class MyRunnable implements Runnable
{
    public void run()
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i ++)
        {
            System.out.println("Child Thread !");
        }
        Thread.yield();
        ---------------
    }
}

public class DemoYeildMethod
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        MyRunnable obj = new MyRunnable();
        Thread t = new Thread(obj);
        t.start();
        


        for(int i = 0 ; i < 10; i ++)
        {
            System.out.println("Main Thread !");
        }

    }
}

- If we write yeild(); method then child Thread will always call yeild(); method to give the chance to main method, so main method will get 
the chance more no. of times and the chance of completing main method is high.

- Some platforms wont provide proper support for yeilf(); method .

- if we comment Thread.yeild(); line then we can not expect the which Thread will gate chance however if we are not commenting 
then child Thread will always call yeild(); method, so we can expect Main Thread will get executed more no. of times than Child Thread.


What is the purpose of yeild(); method ?  :
-------------------------------------------

The processer which required more processing time in the middle we can define yeild(); method to give the chance to other waiting Threads. 







2. join(); method : 
-------------------

-If a Thread wants to wait until completing some other Thread then we should go for join(); method.

- Assume Thread "t1" wants to wait until completing "t2" then "t1" has to call call " t2.join(); " method.

- If t1 executes t2.join(); then t1 will immidietly enter into waiting state until t2 completes.

- Once t2 completes then t1 can continue its execution. 




Join method with diffrent argumets : 
------------------------------------

1. public final void join()

2. public final void (long ms)

3. public final void (long ms, int ns)
 

- Every join(); method throghs InterruptedException which is checked exception , hence we have to handle that exception either by using 
try catch block or by using throws keyword otherwise we will get compile time error.


example-1 : 
---------

Waiting of child thread until completing main Thread : 
-------------------------------------------------------






class MyRunnable implements Runnable
{
    public static Thread mt;

    public void run()
    {
         try
                {
                    mt.join();
                }
                catch(InterruptedException ie)
                {

                }
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println("Child Thread !");
        }
    }
    
}
public class DemoJoinMethod2
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException
    {
        MyRunnable.mt = Thread.currentThread();
        MyRunnable obj = new MyRunnable();
        Thread t = new Thread(obj);
        t.start();
        


        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            System.out.println("Main Thread !");
            Thread.sleep(500);

        }
    }
}

- If we comment line t.join(); then both main and child Thread will execute simultaniously and we can not expect exact output, it depends on 
Thread Scheduler and if we dont comment the line t.join(); then main Thread will be waiting until completing the child Thread. In this case
the output we will get is child Thread 10 times followed by main Thread.







// Waiting of Child thread until completing main thread 
---------------------------------------------------------

example-2: 
----------




class MyRunnable implements Runnable
{
    public static Thread mt;

    public void run()
    {
         try
                {
                    mt.join();
                }
                catch(InterruptedException ie)
                {

                }
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println("Child Thread !");
        }
    }
    
}
public class DemoJoinMethod2
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException
    {
        MyRunnable.mt = Thread.currentThread();
        MyRunnable obj = new MyRunnable();
        Thread t = new Thread(obj);
        t.start();


        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            System.out.println("Main Thread !");
            Thread.sleep(500);

        }
    }
}

- In the above example-2 Child thread calls join(); method on main Thread object hence child thread has to wait until completing main
thread in this case the output we will get is main thread 10 times followed by child thread.









DeadLock : 
----------




case -1 example : 
-----------------
- In java, Assume a process or thread named "child Thread" is waiting for completing of "main thread" and main thread waiting for 
"child thread" in this situation Program gets stucked and waiting of two process or thread for each other this concept is know as 
DeadLock.



/* 
 In this examole both of the Threads call join(); method and waiting for each other .. in this case program will get stucked and 
we will not get any output. This concept is called as DeadLock
*/


class MyRunnable implements Runnable
{
    public static Thread tObject;

    public void run()
    {
        try
        {
            tObject.join();
        }
        catch(InterruptedException ie)
        {

        }

        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i ++)
        {
            System.out.println("Child Thread !");
        }
    }
}
public class DeadLock
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException
    {
        MyRunnable.tObject = Thread.currentThread();
        MyRunnable obj = new MyRunnable();
        Thread t = new Thread(obj);
        t.start();
        t.join();

        for(int i = 0 ; i < 10; i++)
        {
            System.out.println("Main Thread !");
        }
    }
}







Deadlock example-2 :
---------------------

If a Thread calls join(); method on the same Thread it's self then the program will be stucked for infinity time this situation is called
as DeadLock. 


example:
--------


public class DeadLockDemo2
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException
    {

    Thread.currentThread().join();  
      
    }
}










sleep(); Method:
----------------





There are two types of sleep(); method : 
----------------------------------------

1. public static native void sleep(long ms)
2. public static void sleep(long ms, int ns)


- Every sleep(); method throughs InterruptedException, which is checked exception hence whenever we are using sleep(); Method
compulsory we should handle InterruptedException either by "try catch" or by "throws keyword" otherwise we will get compile time 
error.


// Example of sleep(); method  :
---------------------------------



public class MethodSleepDemo
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i ++)
        {
            System.out.println("Slide- " + i);

            try
             {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
             }
            catch(InterruptedException ie)
             {
            
             }
        }
        
    }
}


public void interrupt(); method : 
---------------------------------


- A Thread can interrupt a sleeping Thread or waiting Thread by using interrupt(); method of Thread class 



This is How a Thread can interrupt another Thread : 
---------------------------------------------------


class MyRunnable implements Runnable
{
    public void run() 
    {
        try
            {
        for(int i = 0 ; i < 10; i ++)
        {
            System.out.println("I am Executing !");
            
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            
            
        }
            }
            catch(InterruptedException ie)
            {
                System.out.println("I got interrupted !");
            }
    }
}

public class InterruptingThread
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        MyRunnable obj = new MyRunnable();
        Thread t = new Thread(obj);
        t.start();
        t.interrupt();


      
        System.out.println("End of Main Thread !");
        

    }
}


- If we comment line Thread.interrupt(); , then main thread wont interrupt child thread. In this case child thread will execute
for loop 10 times.

-If we are not commenting Thread.interrupt(); then main thread interrupts child thread in this case the output is :


output:
-------
End of Main Thread !
I am Executing !
I got interrupted !



- whenever we are calling interrupt(); method if target thread not in sleeping or waiting state then there is no impact of 
interrupt call immidietly. interrupt call will be waited until target thread enter into sleeping or waiting state.

- If the target thread Thread enter into sleep or waiting thread then immidietly interrupt call will interrupt the target thread.

- If the target thread never enter into sleeping or waiting state then there is no impact of interrupt call and this is the only 
case where interrupt call will be wasted .







Diffrence between yeild();, join();, and sleep(); method : 
-----------------------------------------------------------

yield();
--------

purpose : 
---------
- If a thread wants to pause its execution to give the chance to other threads with same priority then we should go for yeild(); method.

- is yeild(); method overloaded method or not ?    _ yeild(); is not overloaded method 

- is it final method                               - NO

- is it throghs InterruptedException ?             - YES

- is it native or not  ?                           - YES



join();
-------

purpose:
--------
- If a thread want to wait until completing of some other threads then we should go for join(); method .

- is join(); method overloaded method or not ?   _ join(); is overloaded method 

- is it final method                             _ YES

- is it throghs InterruptedException ?           - YES

- is it native or not  ?                         - NO


sleep();
--------

purpose:
--------
- If a thread doesn't want to perfome any activities or operations then we should go for sleep method .

- is sleep(); method overloaded method or not ?   _ sleep(); is overloaded method 

- is it final method                             _ NO

- is it throghs InterruptedException ?           - YES

- is it native or not  ?                         - sleep(long ms) is native method and sleep(long ms, int ns) is not native







SYNCHRONIZATION  :
------------------

- Synchronized is a modifier applicable only for methods and blocks but not for classes and variables 

- If multiple threads are trying to operate simultaniously on the same Java Object then there may be a chance of 
Data Inconsistency problem .

- To overcome this problem we should go for Synchronized keyword.

- If a method or block is defined as Synchronized then at a time only one thread is allowed to execute that method or block, so 
that Data Inconsistency problem will be resolved. 

- Internally SYNCHRONIZATION concept is implemented by using lock. Every object in Java has a unique lock.Whenever we are using 
Synchronized keyword then only lock concept will be avilable.

- If a thread wants to execute Synchronized method on the given object first it has to get lock of that object, Once thread
got the lock then it it allowed to execute any Synchronized method on that object.

- Once method execution completes autometically thread releses the lock.

- Aquring and relesing lock internally takes care by the JVM and programmer is not responsible for this activity.

- While a thread executing Synchronized method on the given object the remaining threads are not allowed to execute simultaniously
on the same object, but remaining threads are allowed to execute non-Synchronized method simultaniously.

- Lock concept is implemented based on object but not based on method.



Advantage of Synchronized keyword : 
-----------------------------------

- The main advantages of Synchronized keyword is we can resolve Data Inconsistency problems


Disadvantage of Synchronized keyword :
--------------------------------------- 

- The main disadvantage of Synchronized keyword is it increses waiting time of Threads and creats perfomance problem, hence if 
there is no specific requirment then it is not recommended to use Synchronized keyword. 




Synchronized example-1 : 
------------------------






class Display 
{
    public synchronized void wish(String name) 
     {
         for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
        {
            System.out.print("Good Morning :");

            try 
            {
                Thread.sleep(500);
            } 
            catch (InterruptedException ie) 
            {

            }
            System.out.println(name);
        }

    }
}
class MyThread extends Thread
{
    Display d;
    String name;

    MyThread(Display d, String name)
    {
        this.d = d;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void run()
    {
        d.wish(name);
    }
    
}
public class SynchronizedDemo1
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Display d = new Display();
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread(d, "Rakesh");
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread(d, "Bikash");
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}





- If we are not declaring wish(); method as synchronized then both threads will be executed simultaniously, hence we will get 
irregular output.

- If we declare wish(); method as synchronized then at a time only one thread will allowed to execute on the given Display object
hence we will get regular output.




class level lock : 
------------------

- Every class in java has a unique lock which is nothing but class level lock. 

- If a Thread wants to execute a static synchronized method then thread required class level lock. 

- Once thread got class level lock then it is allowed to execute any synchronized of that class.

- Once method execution completes autometically thread releses lock.

 
- While a thread executing static synchronized method the remaining threads aren't allowed to execute any static synchronized method 
of that class simultaniously, but remaining threads are allowed to execute the following method simultaniously :-

                    1. normal static method
                    2. synchronized instance method
                    3. normal instance method





Synchronized example-2 : 
------------------------





class Display
{
    public synchronized void displayN()
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i ++)
        {
            System.out.print(i);
            try
            {
                Thread.sleep(500);
            }
            catch(InterruptedException ie)
            {

            }
        }
    }
    

    public synchronized void displayC()
    {
        for(int i = 65; i < 75; i++)
        {
            System.out.print((char) i);

            try
            {
            Thread.sleep(500);
            }
            catch(InterruptedException ie)
            {

            }
        }
        
    }
}
class MyThread1 extends Thread
{
    Display d;

    MyThread1(Display d)
    {
        this.d = d;
    }

    public void run()
    {
        d.displayN();
    }
}
class MyThread2 extends Thread
{
    Display d;

    MyThread2(Display d)
    {
        this.d = d;

    }

    public void run()
    {
        d.displayC();
    }
}
public class Synchronized2
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Display d = new Display();
        MyThread1 t1 = new MyThread1(d);
        MyThread2 t2 = new MyThread2(d);
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}








Synchronized Block  :
----------------------

- If very few lines of the code required synchronization then it is not recommended to declare entire method as synchronized. We have 
to enclose those few lines of the code by using synchronized block.

- The main Advantage of synchronized block over synchronized method is, it reduces waiting time of the thread and improves perfomance of
the system or application.






- We can declare synchronization block as follows : 
----------------------------------------------------



To get lock of current object : 
-------------------------------

synchronized(this)
{
    // Lines of code 
}

- If a Thread got the lock of current object then only it is allowed to execute this area.




Synchronized current object level lock example : 
-------------------------------------


class Display 
{
    public void wish(String name)
    {
        // 1 lack lines of codes

    synchronized(this)
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            System.out.print("Good Morning :");

            try
            {
                Thread.sleep(500);
            }
            catch(InterruptedException ie)
            {

            }
            System.out.println(name);
        }

        // 1 lack lines of codes
    }
  }
}
class MyThread extends Thread
{
    Display d;
    String name;

    MyThread(Display d, String name)
    {
        this.d = d;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void run()
    {
        d.wish(name);
    }
}
public class CurrentObjectSynchronizedBlock
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Display obj = new Display();
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread(obj, "Rakesh ");
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread(obj, "Bikash");
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}







































To get class level lock : 
-------------------------

synchronized(Display.class)
{
    // Lines of Code 
}

- If a Thread got the class level lock of "Display" class then only it is allowed to execute this area.



Synchronized class level lock example :
---------------------------------------- 



//Synchronized class level lock



class Display 
{
    public void wish(String name)
    {
        // 1 lack lines of code 

    synchronized(Display.class)
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i ++)
        {
            System.out.print("Good Morning :");

            try
            {
                Thread.sleep(500);
            }
            catch(InterruptedException ie)
            {

            }
            System.out.println(name);
         }
        }
    }
}
class MyThread extends Thread
{
    Display d;
    String name;

    MyThread(Display d, String name)
    {
        this.d = d;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void run()
    {
        d.wish(name);
    }
}
public class SynchronizedClassLevelLock
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Display d1 = new Display();
        Display d2 = new Display();
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread(d1, "Rakesh");
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread(d2, "Bikash");
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}



- Lock concept is applicable for object types and class types but not for premitives, hence we can not pass premitive type as the argument 
to synchronized block otherwise we will get compile time error saying " unexpected type found: int required: reference ".

int val = 10;

synchronized(val)
{

}



FAQ :
----

what us Race condition ? 
-------------------------

- If multiple threads are operating simultaniously on the same java object then there may be a chance of data Inconsistency problem this 
is called race condition. We can overcome this issue by using synchronized keyword.



What is object lock and when it is required ? 
----------------------------------------------

- Every object in java has a unique lock which is known as object lock. When a Thread wants to execute synchronized instance method
then object lock is required.


what is class level lock and when it is required? 
-------------------------------------------------

- Every class in java has a unique lock . when a thread wants to execute static synchronized method then class level lock is required.


What is the Diffrence between Object level lock and class level lock ? 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

-  When a Thread wants to execute synchronized instance method then object lock is required and when a thread wants to execute static 
synchronized method then class level lock is required.


What is synchronized statement ? 
--------------------------------

- The statement present in synchronized method and synchronized block are call synchronized statements.





Inter Thread Communication : 
-----------------------------

- Two threads can communicate with each other by using wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods. 

- The thread which is excepting updation is responsible to call wait() method then immidietly the thread will enter into waiting state.

- The thread which is responsible for performing updation, after performing updation it is responsible to call notify() method then
waiting thread will get that notification and continue its execution with those updated items.

- To call  wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods on any object, Thread should be owner of that object that is the thread should have
lock of that object that is the thread should be synchronized area.

- Hence we can call wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods only from synchronized area, otherwise we will get RunTimeException saying
"IlligalMonitorStateException ". 

- If a Thread calls wait() method on any object it immidietly releses the lock of that particular object and enter into waiting state.

- If Thread calls notify() method on any object it releses the lock of that object but may not immidietly.

- Except wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() there is no other method where thread releses the lock.




Producer & Consumer example : 
-----------------------------

- Producer thread is responsible to produce items to the queue and Consumer is responsible for consume items form the queue.

- If queue is empty then consumer thread will call wait() method and enter into waiting state.

- After Producer thread produce items to the queue, Producer thread is response to call notify() method then waiting consumer thread
will get that notification and continue the execution with updated items.

  





Why wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods present in Object class but not in Thread class ? 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() method present in Object claas but not in Thread class because Thread can call thease methods on 
any Java Object.



    - public final void wait()  throws ie

    - public final void wait(long ms) throws IE

    - public final void wait(long ms, int ns) throws IE

    - public final native void notify()

    - public final native void notify()



- Every wait() method throughs interrupt exception which is checked exception hence when we use wait() method compulsory we should 
handle this InterruptedException either by try catch or by throws keyword otherwise we will get compile time error.



Diffrence between notify() & notifyAll() method : 
-------------------------------------------------

- We can use notify() method to give the notification to only one waiting thread. If multiple threads are waiting then only one thread
will notify and remaining threads have to wait for further notifications.

- Which thread wil be notified we can not expect, it depends on Thread Scheduler or JVM.

- We can use notifyAll() method to give the notification to all waiting threads of particular object. Eventhough multiple threads 
notify but execution will be performed one by one because threads required lock and only one lock is avilable.















DEADLOCK : 
-----------

- If two threads are Waiting for each other for infinity amount of time is called DeadLock.

- Synchronized keyword is the only reason for deadlock situation. Hence while using synchronized keyword we have to take special care.

- Threr are no resolution techniquies for deadlock but several pevention techniquies are avilable.






Diffrence between DeadLock and Starvetion : 
-------------------------------------------


- Long waiting of a thread where waiting never ends is called deadlock.

- long waiting of a thread where waiting ends at certain points. ex - low priority thread has to wait until completing all high priority
thread . It may be long waiting but ends at certain point which is nothing but Starvetion.
